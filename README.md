## Music Player – HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This repository contains a simple music player project built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

⚠ *Note:*  
The music files are not included in this repository because the files I originally chose were too large to upload.

### How to Use:
If you want to run this music player:
1. Replace the existing song file name(s) in the code with your own audio files.
2. Make sure the files are small enough to be supported by GitHub.

Feel free to use or modify the code for your own projects. If you need any help, feel free to reach out!
